//My Simple Practice Tasks in C (Cs50x Harvard Course)

//This is a random selection of brief tasks I created whilst working through the Harvard CS50 introduction to computer science course. Some tasks may be directly taken from the course itself but are all certainly sections of code already written within the course. . 

//The point of putting these together is so I could start with an empty file and type the code myself simply by taking the instruction then trying to get it to work without looking. I only look when I get stuck. Great for memory muscle!. Although more importantly, these short tasks help me understand the code better and partly what is happening under the hoood, albeit in an abstract way. 

//I used the cs50 ide (provided in the course) to run this code.

//There are times when I have added ALL the libraries (at the top) for every task, regardless of whether or not they are required. And other times they are ommitted.

//I am not a teacher. I created these tasks to improve my muscle memory and -as i said - develop a deeper understanding of how memory works, before working on more complex algorythms.

//I believe that getting a solid grounding on the basic concepts of C, will help me better understand abstraction and really grasp the fact that when I type a line of code, a lot is happening under the hood. This gets more exciting when delving into other higher level languages.

//My code won't be perfect and I welcome feedback from others. (If I don't get feedback then how can I learn?)

//My explanations may not be accurate but they have helped me to understand every step of my code.

//I try, whenever I can, to run a program in main then run the same program with my own function. This isn't alwys straight forward and is well worth the practice. I am particularly thinking about the 'swap' task.

//Anyway, I hope beginners have a go and find this useful.
