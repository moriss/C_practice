For beginners who are overwhelemed with coding!

My Simple Practice Tasks in C (Cs50x Harvard Course 2020)

This is a random selection of brief tasks I added to my repo whilst working through the Harvard CS50 introduction to computer science course 2020.

Learning C for me is certainly a steep learning curve so I decided to stick to mini sections of code that are easily digestible.

So this is what I recomend. 
1) Open a file and read through the code and comments. 
2) Try to recreate the code, testing it in the cs50 IDE.
3) Where you have made mistakes (and there will be many), make a note of them in a separate 'common error' file.

So the goal is to be able to recreate the code in a blank file so you build up the brain muscle as you move forward onto more complex stuff. 

It's important you tackle things in small steps and give yourself lots of breaks.

When things go wrong (which is fairly common) Just remember that your brain is not a computer so don't be disapointed when it doesn't act like one.

If you become disolusioned because you are spendig such a long time on coding the 'simplest' of tasks, be aware that you are building solid foiundations.

Think of this exercise as building a menu of tools you can use for future coding jobs. The more time you spend understanding loops or 

There are times when I have added ALL the libraries (at the top) for every task, regardless of whether or not they are required. And other times they are ommitted.

I am not a teacher. I created these tasks to improve my muscle memory and -as i said - develop a deeper understanding of how memory works, before working on more complex algorythms.

//I believe that getting a solid grounding on the basic concepts of C, will help me better understand abstraction and really grasp the fact that when I type a line of code, a lot is happening under the hood. This gets more exciting when delving into other higher level languages.

//My code won't be perfect and I welcome feedback from others. (If I don't get feedback then how can I learn?)

//My explanations may not be accurate but they have helped me to understand every step of my code.

//I try, whenever I can, to run a program in main then run the same program with my own function. This isn't alwys straight forward and is well worth the practice. I am particularly thinking about the 'swap' task.

//Anyway, I hope beginners have a go and find this useful.
