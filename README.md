//My Simple Practice Tasks in C (Cs50x Harvard Course)

//This is a random selection of brief tasks I created whilst working through the Harvard CS50 introduction to computer science course.

//I used the cs50 ide (provided in the course) to run this code.

//For simplicity, I have always added ALL the libraries (at the top) for every task, regardless of whether or not they are required. 

//I am not a teacher. I created these tasks to improve my muscle memory and develop a deeper understanding of how memory works, before working on more complex algorythms.

//I believe that getting a solid grounding on the basic concepts of C, will help me better understand abstraction and really grasp the fact that when I type a line of code, a lot is happening under the hood. This gets more exciting when delving into other higher level languages.

//My code won't be perfect and I welcome feedback from others. (If I don't get feedback then how can I learn?)

//My explanations may not be accurate but they have helped me to understand every step of my code.

//I try, whenever I can, to run a program in main then run the same program with my own function. This isn't alwys straight forward and is well worth the practice. I am particularly thinking about the 'swap' task.

//Anyway, I hope beginners have a go and find this useful.
